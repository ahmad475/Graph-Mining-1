# Graph-Mining-1

**ABSTRACT:**

In this assignment I created randomly generated networks of three
types and performed various analysis on each of these networks.
For the assignment I used networkx python library along with matplotlib to perform the various network measurements and to also
display the results and statistics of those network measurements.

**Part 1 ERDŐS-RÉNYI RANDOM GRAPH MODEL:**

In this section I have created 3 Erdős-Rényi random graph models
and for each of these models I have generated 1000 nodes and about
10,000 edges for each of the graphs.

**Part 2 BARABÁSI–ALBERT PREFERENTIAL ATTACHMENT MODEL:**

In this section I have created 3 W Barabási–Albert preferential
attachment models and for each of these models I have generated
1000 nodes and about 10,000 edges for each of the graphs.

**3 WATTS–STROGATZ SMALL-WORLD GRAPH MODEL:**

In this section I have created 3 Watts–Strogatz small-world
graph models and for each of these models I have generated
1000 nodes and about 10,000 edges for each of the graphs.
